Estimate the average number of platelets per field using 10 different fields, where the RBCs are evenly dispersed. Avoid field in which RBCs strongly overlap as this will falsely increase the platelet estimate. Multiply this result by 20,000 to obtain an approximation of the platelet count.  3. A normal platelet count would show 8-20 plt/field; or one platelet per 10-30 RBCs.  4. NOTE: If platelet clumps or satellitism are seen, an estimate cannot be performed. Notify physician of problem. If indicated advise redraw in the appropriate anticoagulant, sodium citrate (blue-top). Order will need to be placed for a CBC SODIUM CITRATE test. This will automatically order both lav & blue tubes.    III. REFERENCES:    A. A Color Atlas and Instruction Manual of Peripheral Blood Cells Morphology, by Barbara H. O'Connor, 1984, p. 20.  B.

Count the number of both intact and disrupted WBCs in each of 10 microscopic fields in different areas of the slide where RBCs slightly overlap. Divide the total number by 10 to establish the mean number of WBCs/field and multiply this mean by 3,000 to get the estimated WBC count/mm³. Do not round off the mean, e.g., if the mean is 5.7 do not round off to 6 but leave the figure at one place past the decimal point for greater accuracy.  3.

Estimate the average number of platelets per field using 10 different fields, where the RBCs are evenly dispersed. Avoid field in which RBCs strongly overlap as this will falsely increase the platelet estimate. Multiply this result by 20,000 to obtain an approximation of the platelet count.  3. A normal platelet count would show 8-20 plt/field; or one platelet per 10-30 RBCs.  4. NOTE: If platelet clumps or satellitism are seen, an estimate cannot be performed. Notify physician of problem. If indicated advise redraw in the appropriate anticoagulant, sodium citrate (blue-top). Order will need to be placed for a CBC SODIUM CITRATE test.

Divide the total number by 10 to establish the mean number of WBCs/field and multiply this mean by 3,000 to get the estimated WBC count/mm³. Do not round off the mean, e.g., if the mean is 5.7 do not round off to 6 but leave the figure at one place past the decimal point for greater accuracy.  3.
